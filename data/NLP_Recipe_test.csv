divided, black pepper, poppy or sesame seeds for topping, nonstick cooking spray, vegetable oil","1/2 cup canola oil, 1/2 cup melted unsalted butter, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 cup hot water, 3 cups flour, 6 oz crumbled feta cheese, 6 oz crumbled kashkaval cheese, 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped, 3 large eggs, divided, 1/4 tsp black pepper, poppy or sesame seeds for topping, nonstick cooking spray, vegetable oil","first, make your pasty dough . combine canola oil, melted butter, and salt in a mixing bowl . mix in the hot not boiling water . gradually stir in the flour, a 1/2 cupful at a time, till a soft and oily dough forms.when the dough becomes too thick to stir, use your hands to work the last bit of flour into the dough . don't over knead stop when the ball holds together and the dough is smooth . cover with plastic wrap and let it sit for a few minutes while you make your filling . don't let the dough sit for longer than 30 minutes before rolling it out, or it will cool down and become more difficult to work with.in a food processor, combine feta and kashkaval cheeses, parsley, 2 eggs and black pepper in a food processor . pulse ingredients till a light creamy paste forms . this is your sambusak filling . preheat your oven to 350 degrees f . while oven is heating, assemble your sambusak . there are a couple of ways to do this . the half moon shape is more popular because it's easiest to do the triangle shape is popular for purim because it's reminiscent of haman's hat . to make half moon shape flour your rolling surface . pull a walnut sized piece of dough from the dough ball recover the dough ball with plastic . roll the small piece of dough into a ball with your hands . lightly flour your rolling pin . roll the dough out into a rough circle that is between 4 1/2 and 5 inches wide . the dough will be quite thin . place 1 tbsp of filling in the center of the circle . fold the circle in half over the filling . seal the edges by pinching gently with your fingers to create a half moon shape . use a fork to score the edges of the sambusak this will help seal them and also make them look pretty.repeat process until all of the dough has been used . i find it's easiest to roll out five dough pieces at a time, stuff them and seal them, then roll out five more . this saves time and is more efficient them rolling, stuffing and sealing each individual piece . to make triangle shape flour your rolling surface . divide your dough into four equal sized sections.choose one section to work with, keep the other sections under plastic wrap till you're ready to use them.lightly flour your rolling pin . roll the dough out till it is very thin . you will want to cut a square with 8 to 10 inch sides from the dough, so keep this in mind as you roll it out i sometimes use a ruler to help gauge the size . once your dough is rolled out, cut a square with equal length sides from the dough . the square should be somewhere between 8 inches and 10 inches wide . use a ruler or straight edge to cut the sides as straight as possible.push extra dough trimmings into a small ball and store it under the plastic wrap separate from the rest of the dough . cut the square into equal sized quarters . each of these quarters will be used to form a sambusak.cut the square into equal sized quarters . each of these quarters will be used to form a sambusak . place 1 tbsp of filling into the center of each square . fold one corner of a square over to the diagonally opposite corner and pinch to seal the sides . use a fork to score the edges of the sambusak this will help seal them and also make them look pretty . repeat process for remaining squares . roll out remaining dough sections in the same way, using the ball of trimmings as a fifth and final section of dough.once your sambusak have been assembled, they are ready to be cooked . you can either deep fry them or bake them . i prefer to bake them because of the more consistent results plus it's healthier but frying is more traditional . to bake sambusak place sambusak on a lightly greased or parchment lined cookie sheet.beat the remaining egg with 1 tsp of cold water . brush the sambusak with a thin layer of the egg wash . sprinkle the sambusak with poppy seeds or sesame seeds, if desired . bake sambusak at 350 degrees f for about 40 45 minutes until golden brown . to fry sambusak do not use egg wash or coat with seeds . heat an oil with a high smoke point like grapeseed over medium until hot, but not smoking.fry the sambusak in batches of four till golden, turning halfway through cooking . drain on a paper towel before serving.serve sambusak warm or at room temperature . they're best straight from the oven, but the baked ones also keep quite well, and can be reheated in the microwave if desired."

cubes, 3 cups all purpose flour, 2 tsp salt, 1 cup very cold unsalted butter","pour cold water into a small dish with a few pieces of ice to chill . there are two ways to integrate the butter into the dry ingredients... by hand mixing or with a food processor . in my experience, both methods work equally well as long as you mix the water in by hand . don't process the water into the dough, or you'll end up with a tough crust . break up butter by hand add flour and salt to a large mixing bowl, stir with a fork to blend . take cold butter out of the refrigerator and add it to the bowl . use a pastry cutter to cut the cold butter into the flour, using firm pressure and pushing down repeatedly to break the butter into small pieces . work as quickly as you comfortably can . stop when the flour and butter mixture looks like large curd cottage cheese . there should be a variety of sizes in the butter pieces... the largest should be about the size of a pea . place flour and butter mixture in the freezer for 2 minutes before proceeding . mixing dough with food processor fit your processor with a blade attachment . add flour and salt to the food processor . take cold butter out of the refrigerator and add it to the processor . pulse the processor in 3 second bursts to break up the butter . stop when the flour and butter mixture looks like large curd cottage cheese . there should be a variety of sizes in the butter pieces... the largest should be about the size of a pea . it should only take 10 12 pulses to get the right consistency start checking consistency after 8 pulses . make sure you don't over process... having a variety of sizes in the butter chunks will make a flakier dough . mixture should hold together when squeezed in your hand . pour mixture into a mixing bowl . place flour and butter mixture in the freezer for 2 minutes before proceeding . take ice water out of the refrigerator . add water to the flour mixture one tablespoonful at a time, using a fork to lightly toss the liquid into the dough . try not to touch the dough as you mix you want the mixture to stay as cool as possible . you may not need all the liquid to bring the dough together, so add slowly... the dough can easily turn wet and sticky if you're not careful . by the same token, you may need a bit more liquid . pie dough is not an exact science every batch of dough will be different . when the dough begins to look stringy and larger lumps begin to form, take a fistful of the dough and squeeze it in your palm . open your palm . if the dough holds together well and is just slightly tacky, it's ready to pull into a dough ball . if the dough easily crumbles in your hand or falls apart, it is still too dry... add a little more liquid . when dough is ready, pull it together with your hands into two balls, one slightly larger than the other . flatten the balls into disks that are 7 8 inches across . cover the disks tightly in plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator immediately . the dough should be refrigerated for at least 1 hour, and up to 48 hours . i prefer to make the dough a day ahead and refrigerate it overnight . you can also freeze the dough for up to 3 months . if you freeze the dough, allow it to thaw and soften a bit before rolling out . to roll out crusts any large, smooth surface will work, as long as it is in a cool dry area . marble is ideal . you will need to work quickly to roll out the dough again, you want it to stay cool, so have any tools you need nearby and ready to go rolling pin, flour, pastry scraper, 9"" pie plate or dish, a sharp knife, and a baking sheet as needed . lightly flour your rolling surface . take the larger of the two dough disks out of the refrigerator and discard the plastic wrap . place it in the center of your rolling surface and sprinkle the top of the disk lightly with flour . use your rolling pin to roll out the dough . i like to roll it from the center outward, a roll in each direction, as though i'm rolling around the face of a clock 12, 3, 6, 9, 12 . you want the dough to expand evenly in all directions, so that it forms a large circular shape . use more pressure in the center of the dough, and less as you near the edges . don't roll past the edge of the dough . as you roll, you may notice cracks forming on the outer edges . if any large cracks develop, pause and pinch the dough together to mend them before rolling again . if the dough becomes sticky as you roll, lightly re flour the surface of the dough before proceeding . when the dough is about halfway rolled out, use a pastry scraper to loosen the dough from the board and flip it over . re flour the board before positioning the dough in the center again . continue to roll out the dough in the same way as before . you want the dough to end up about 1/8"" thick, and as round as possible . as you roll it out, you should see a marbled effect to the dough where patches of butter have formed . this is a good thing those pockets of butter are what make the crust flaky . rolling out pie dough swiftly and efficiently takes practice . you may find that your dough is getting too soft, or the butter pieces are melting, as you roll . a little stickiness can be remedied by a sprinkle of flour, but if the dough is getting warm or the fat is melting you'll need to re chill the dough before proceeding . use the pastry scraper to loosen the dough from the board and place it on a baking sheet . place the baking sheet in the freezer for 1 2 minutes to re chill the dough . continue rolling out . when the dough is about 1/8"" thick all the way around, take your pie dish or plate and center it in the middle of the dough . the dough will need to extend about 2 inches past the edge of the dish . use a sharp knife to cut any rough edges off to form a smooth 2 inch circle around the outer edge of the pie dish . use the pastry scraper to loosen the dough from the rolling surface . gently fold the dough in quarters . pick it up and place it in the pie dish, centering the point of the fold in the middle of the dish . unfold the dough and let it gently settle into the pie dish, lifting the edges of the dough and letting gravity pull it down into the corners . do not stretch the dough to fit the plate let it settle naturally, or you'll end up with a leaky bottom crust . adjust the dough as needed to keep it as centered as possible in the dish . alternatively, you can transfer the crust to the dish by rolling it around the rolling pin and unrolling it over the pie dish . i prefer folding it, since it's easier for me to center in the dish that way, but either method works . when the pie dish has been lined with dough, place it in the refrigerator to chill . take the smaller of the two dough disks out of the refrigerator and roll it out the same way as you did the first . when trimming the edges, the dough only needs to extend about 1 inch beyond the edge of the pie dish . re chill on the baking sheet after rolling out, if necessary . this will be your top crust . assemble your pie by filling the lower crust with your filling... ...dot the filling with butter, if the recipe requires it... ...then lay the top crust gently over the top of the pie . center the top crust as much as possible over the top of the dish . trim the edges of both crusts so that they are a little less than 1/2 inch beyond the rim of the pie dish . roll the lower crust over the top of the upper crust and pinch gently to form a lip or edge to the crust . work your way around the pie, rolling and pinching, until the circle is completed . finish your edges by scalloping or crimping them with a fork . i like to scallop the crust by using the forefinger of one hand to make a crease, then pinching around the crease with the thumb and forefinger of the other hand . i work my way around the inner edge of the pie first making creases, then i finish it by working around the outer edge, scalloping in the opposite direction . chill the fully assembled pie for at least 10 minutes before baking . make an egg or milk wash and brush on the upper crust for a nicely browned finish optional . milk washes can be a bit uneven, so i prefer an egg wash use an egg yolk whisked together with 1 tsp of water . this will give it a nice golden sheen . cut slits in the upper crust to vent after the wash, not before, and sprinkle the top of the pie with sugar, if desired . i sometimes like to sprinkle it with turbinado sugar to add a light candy like crunch and a little sparkle . bake pie according to recipe directions . during the baking process, i usually turn the pie 180 degrees about halfway through the cooking time to make sure the crust browns evenly ovens can be hotter in the back than in the front this allows for more even heat distribution . if these instructions are followed carefully, you should end up with a flavorful, flaky pie crust happy baking."

7d24650d-b944-4a53-840b-001ede87b0a6,keto buttermilk biscuits,"buttery, flaky, melt in your mouth, southern style biscuits . a distant dream on the keto diet not after you try this recipe the recipe is a yummly original created by sara mellas https //www.yummly.com/dish/author/sara 20mellas . when we think of traditional biscuits in the united states, what comes to mind are golden brown, buttery baked rounds that flake and crumble and make a multitude of evils disappear in the time it takes to eat one . whether they're split down the middle and drizzled with honey, or they're smothered in sausage gravy alongside a plate of fried chicken, or they're dressed up with cheddar cheese and garlic, biscuits will make tastebuds tingle any way they're served . low carb confusion like most pastry and bread recipes, flour biscuits, though indubitably delicious, will probably never be considered health food . and low carb forget about it with refined flour as the primary ingredient, these high glycemic treats when prepared traditionally are an occasional indulgence for most, and completely off limits for those following gluten free, grain free, paleo, or keto diets . but to have a dietary restriction or preference does not eliminate the desire to occasionally mainline a buttery biscuit straight to the mouth . though it may not be possible to stop into the nearest store for a grain free biscuit, with this biscuit recipe you can make keto buttermilk biscuits at home in under 45 minutes but...buttermilk a lot of dairy drinks like milk are not considered keto because they contain about 12 g of carbs per cup . buttermilk has the same amount of carbs, but in this recipe uses 1/2 cup of buttermilk for 12 14 biscuits . that means the buttermilk only contributes about 1/2 carb to each biscuit . unless you're eating a whole batch of biscuits in one sitting, the buttermilk carbs aren't a big issue . main ingredient swap as with most low carb recipes for keto friendly baked goods, the main dry ingredient used in these biscuits is almond flour in place of the white flour common in other biscuits recipes . for the best results, steer clear of grinding your own almond meal at home and instead opt for the super fine ground and blanched almond flour that can be found in the baking or specialty aisles of most grocery stores . unfortunately, coarse, homemade almond meal is too heavy and high moisture for producing the flaky biscuits we're after in this keto recipe . transferrable techniques when making biscuits of any kind, it is extremely important that all the ingredients be kept very cold . low temperatures ensure that pieces of butter stay solid in the dough prior to entering the oven . once the biscuits begin to bake, the butter pieces release steam to create pockets, resulting in tender, flaky layers, which is why it's important that the butter holds its shape and moisture until baking time . with melted butter and a low carb or no carb flour, you'd end up with flat and dense disks . this means the butter, egg, and buttermilk should be kept as cold as possible in the refrigerator before and during the mixing, shaping, and cutting of the dough . additionally, for an optimal outcome, we recommend placing your almond meal and mixing bowl in the freezer yes, really, the bowl for 30 minutes before you plan to start these low carb biscuits . another key component in biscuit making is to make sure you don't overwork the dough . handle it as gently and as little as possible when mixing, rolling, and cutting the biscuit rounds . this way the heat from your hands will not soften the butter pieces, and your final keto biscuits will have a melt in your mouth texture . low carb caveat do these keto/low carb biscuits taste exactly like their traditional flour based counterparts will they fool the savviest wheat connoisseurs most likely not . however, that's not to say they aren't a convincingly close alternative for low carb diets, boasting far more nutritional value . so the next time you're craving a golden brown, oven fresh, fluffy biscuit low on net carbs, give this recipe a try, and see if you can stop after just one",https://www.yummly.com/private/recipe/Keto-Buttermilk-Biscuits-2516787?layout=prep-steps,"almond flour, baking powder, salt, unsalted butter, egg, buttermilk","4.5 cup almond flour, 4.0 teaspoon

baking powder, and salt in a large mixing bowl . cut the butter into small cubes and add to the mixing bowl . with a pastry cutter or two butter knives, cut the butter into the almond flour until it is sandy in texture, with pea sized crumbs . whisk together the egg and buttermilk in a small bowl . pour over the almond flour and butter mixture . using a rubber spatula, gently fold the milk and almond flour mixtures together just until a ragged dough forms . do not over handle the dough . sprinkle a work surface with almond flour . turn the dough onto the surface, and gently roll it out to a 3/4 inch thick sheet . use a 2.5 3 inch round cutter to cut out the biscuits, collecting the scraps and re rolling the dough until you have 12 14 rounds . place the biscuits on the prepared baking sheet . transfer the baking sheet to the freezer for 15 minutes . remove the baking sheet from the freezer . for a rich, brown crust, brush the tops of the biscuits with a thin layer of beaten egg with a pastry brush . transfer the baking sheet to the middle rack of the preheated oven . bake for 16 18 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through cooking time, until they are puffy and golden brown at the edges . remove the baking sheet from the oven . allow the biscuits to cool for at least 5 minutes before serving . recipe notes biscuits are best eaten within a few hours of baking . leftover

challah.,https://toriavey.com/toris-kitchen/apple-honey-challah/,"lukewarm water, divided, active dry yeast, sugar, egg, egg yolks, honey, canola oil, vanilla, salt, flour, medium granny smith apples, sugar, turbinado sugar, egg, cold water, salt","1 1/2 cups lukewarm water, divided, 1/4 oz active dry yeast, 1 tsp sugar, 1 large egg, 3 large egg yolks, 3/4 cup honey, 2 tbsp canola oil, 2 tsp vanilla, 2 tsp salt, 5 7 cups flour, 3 medium granny smith apples, 1/4 cup sugar, 2 tbsp turbinado sugar, 1 large egg, 1 tbsp cold water, 1/2 tsp salt","pour 1/4 cup of the lukewarm water about 110 degrees into a large mixing bowl . add 1 packet of active dry yeast and 1 tsp of sugar to the bowl, whisk to dissolve . wait 10 minutes . the yeast should have activated, meaning it will look expanded and foamy . if it doesn't, your yeast may have expired, which means your bread won't rise go buy some fresh yeast once your yeast has activated, add remaining 1 1/4 cup lukewarm water to the bowl along with the egg, egg yolks, honey, canola oil, vanilla and salt . use a whisk to thoroughly blend the ingredients together . begin adding the flour to the bowl by half cupfuls, stirring with a large spoon each time flour is added . when mixture becomes too thick to stir, use your hands to knead . continue to add flour and knead the dough until it's smooth, elastic, and not sticky . the amount of flour you will need to achieve this texture varies only add flour until the dough feels pliable and ""right."" turn the dough out onto a smooth surface and knead a few more times . place a saucepan full of water on the stove to boil . wash out the mixing bowl that you used to mix the challah dough . grease the bowl with canola oil . push the dough back into the bottom of the bowl, then flip it over so that both sides are slightly moistened by the oil . cover the bowl with a clean, damp kitchen towel . place the bowl of dough on the middle rack of your oven . take the saucepan full of boiling water and place it below the rack where your dough sits . close the oven, but do not turn it on . the pan of hot water will create a warm, moist environment for your dough to rise . let the dough rise for 1 hour . take the dough bowl out and punch it down several times to remove air pockets . place it back inside the oven and let it rise for 1 hour longer . during this final rise, fill a mixing bowl with cold water and dissolve 1/2 tsp of salt in it . peel the apples and dice them into very small pieces, about 1/4 inch large . place the diced apples into the bowl of lightly salted water . reserve . when you are ready to begin braiding the dough, drain the apple pieces and pat them dry with paper towels . toss the apple pieces with 1/4 cup of sugar . if you'd like, you can add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the sugar to give the apples an apple cinnamon flavor . take the dough out of the oven it should have doubled in size during this final rise . if it has not fully risen, return it to the oven till it's had a chance to properly rise . when the dough is ready, flour a smooth surface like a cutting board . punch the dough down into the bowl a few times, then turn the dough out onto the floured surface . knead the dough a bit, adding flour as needed to keep it from feeling sticky . you will have enough dough for two medium sized challot challahs . divide the dough into two equal halves . put one half of the dough on a smooth, lightly floured surface . leave the other half of the dough in the bowl covered by a moist towel . cut the dough on the floured surface into four equal portions . take one of the four portions and stretch it with your fingers into a rough rectangle, about 1 foot long and 3 4 inches wide . use a rolling pin to smooth the dough, if it helps . the rectangle doesn't need to look perfect, and it shouldn't be too thin the dough needs to be thick enough to handle an apple filling . sprinkle some of the sugared apple pieces across the center of the rectangle . you should use about 1/8 of the apple pieces in each rectangle . liquid will collect in the apple bowl as you progress do not transfer the liquid to the dough, or it will weaken and become mushy . do your best to shake off excess liquid before placing the apples on the dough . leave at least 1/2 inch border along the outer edge of the dough clean, with no apples . gently roll the upper edge of the rectangle down to the lower edge and pinch to seal, creating a snake like roll of dough stuffed with apples . this is the beginning of your strand . gently and carefully roll the stuffed strand till it becomes smooth, using gentle pressure with your hands on the center of the strand, pulling outward as you roll . if any apples begin to poke through the dough, repair the hole with your fingers before you continue . re flour the surface as needed to keep your dough from sticking . taper the ends of the strand by clasping between both palms and rolling . at the end of the rolling process, your strand should be about 16 to 18 inches long with tapered ends . once your apple strand has been rolled, repeat the process with the remaining 3 pieces of dough, making sure that they are even in length with the first strand . in the end, you'll have 4 apple stuffed strands . now your stuffed strands are ready to braid . there are a few different ways to braid 4 strands into a challah . this recipe will guide you through one method for braiding a round four strand challah . for other braiding methods, click here . place two strands in the center of a smooth surface, running parallel top to bottom . place the third strand across the two strands, going under the left strand and over the right . place the fourth strand directly below the third strand, going over the left strand and under the right . you will have something similar to a tic tac toe board pattern, with the center of the board being a very small square and 8 ""legs"" sticking out from that center . keep the center as tight as possible... you'll be braiding from the center . i have numbered the strand ends in the following diagram to make the braiding process easier . take strand 1 and cross it over strand 2. take strand 3 and cross it over strand 4. take strand 5 and cross it over strand 6. take strand 7 and cross it over strand 8. take strand 2 and cross it back the opposite way, over strand 7. take strand 8 and cross it over strand 5. take strand 6 and cross it over strand 3. take strand 4 and cross it over strand 1. take strand 7 and twist it with strand 4. tuck the twisted ends under the challah . repeat this process with the remaining loose ends twist and tuck 1 with 6, then 3 and 8, then 5 and 2. when all of the loose ends are twisted under, gently plump the challah into a nice, even round shape . after the round has been braided, place it on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper . preheat the oven to 350 degrees f . let the braid rise 30 to 45 minutes longer . you'll know the dough is ready to bake when you press your finger into the dough and the indentation stays, rather than bouncing back . while this challah rises, you can braid the other half of the dough in the same way, or you might choose a different braid for your second challah . no matter which way you braid, you can conceal the apple pieces inside the strands using the same method described above . your second challah will rise as the first one bakes . prepare your egg wash by beating the egg, salt and water till smooth . use a pastry brush to brush a thin layer of the mixture onto the visible surface of your challah . reserve the leftover egg wash . sprinkle the top of the challah with 1 tbsp turbinado sugar, if you wish . each challah needs to bake for about 45 minutes total, but to get the best result the baking should be done in stages . first, set your timer to 20 minutes and put your challah in the oven . after 20 minutes, take the challah out of the oven and coat the grooves of the braid with another thin layer of egg wash . these areas tend to expand during baking, exposing dough that will turn white unless they are coated with egg wash . turn the challah around, so the opposite side faces front, and put it back into the oven . turning it will help your challah brown evenly the back of the oven is usually hotter than the front . the challah will need to bake for about 20 minutes longer . for this last part of the baking process, keep an eye on your challah it may be browning faster than it's baking . once the challah is browned to your liking, take it out and tent it with foil, then place it back in the oven . remove the foil for the last 2 minutes of baking time . take the challah out of the oven . at this point your house should smell delicious . test the bread for doneness by turning it over and tapping on the bottom of the loaf if it makes a hollow sound, and it's golden brown all the way across, it's done . because of the apples in this challah, it may take a bit longer to bake than your regular challah recipe . err on the side of letting it cook longer to make sure it's baked all the way through . you can also stick an instant read thermometer in the thickest part of the challah when it reads 190, it is baked all the way through . let challah cool completely on a wire cooling rack before serving . bake the second challah in the same way."

royal icing, icing bottles or pastry bags with fine decorating tips, funnel, toothpicks, decorative elements candies","sugar cookies, 2 batches of royal icing, icing bottles or pastry bags with fine decorating tips, funnel, toothpicks, decorative elements candies","there are two steps to creating beautifully iced sugar cookies flooding and detailing . flooding describes the process used to create a smooth, beautiful ""bed"" of frosting on top of your cookies . this flat frosting surface creates a canvas, which you can then add detail frosting to . both types of icing flood and detail have different textures . each icing step begins with a batch of tinted or white https //toriavey.com/toris kitchen/royal icing/royal icing . first, create your flood icing . for this tutorial, i started with a vibrant blue royal icing for hanukkah . add water to your thick royal icing, a few drops at a time, using a spatula to stir the water in . the texture you are looking to achieve is somewhat similar to the texture of shampoo . frosting can easily go from thick to fluid, so add water carefully and stir frequently until the desired texture is achieved . to check if you have the right texture, use the ""10 second rule."" drag a spatula through the frosting to make a line . count how many seconds it takes for the surface of the frosting to become completely smooth again . it should take around 10 seconds... if it takes more time than that, your frosting needs more water added . if it takes less time, your frosting is too liquid stir in additional powdered sugar to thicken . once your frosting is at the right texture, fill two decorating bottles or pastry bags with the frosting . for the bottle, i use a funnel to pour the frosting in, since the opening of the bottles is rather small . pour frosting into the funnel . agitate it with a thin knife, stirring and pushing the frosting through, till the bottle is full . this may take a few minutes . once your two bottles are full of frosting, attach a tip to each one . i use a 1 round tip small for outlining and a 2 ribbon tip for flooding . place a small bowl with a damp paper towel on the side of your decorating area . you can place the bottles, tip side down, on top of this towel to keep the tips damp and clean royal icing is kind of like cement . once it dries, it can plug up your tips and make decorating difficult . the damp paper towel will help keep this from happening . keep unused icing in a bowl tightly covered with plastic wrap . starting with the 1 tip bottle, squiggle a line on a piece of paper to make sure any air bubbles are pushed out . this will also give you an opportunity to get a ""feel"" for how quickly the frosting will flow from the bottle . next, outline a cookie along the outer edge . this thin tip will create a liquid ""dam"" to keep the flood icing from dripping over the sides of the cookie . as soon as the outline is done, use the 2 tip bottle to fill the center of the cookie with icing . imagine you are ""coloring inside the lines"" in a coloring book . don't overdo it on the icing, a little goes a long way . if you add too much, the icing will leak over the outline you created and make a mess . use the wide 2 tip to spread out the icing across the cookie and nudge it into detailed corners . be patient, this process takes a gentle touch and takes some practice to get right... don't be hard on yourself, and take your time . once the cookie is covered with icing, use a very small spatula or butter knife to smooth out any globs or uneven surfaces . if your icing looks pretty even already, you may not need to do this . use a toothpick to pop any small bubbles that have risen to the surface of the icing . carefully grasp the outer edges of the cookie with two fingers and gently tap the cookie up and down to settle the icing . this will help to smooth out the surface even more . let the icing dry for at least 3 hours, up to 24 hours . i let them dry overnight to make sure they're nice and firm before moving on to the detail icing stage . once your flooded cookies are completely dry, you're ready to play with detail icing, you can ""draw"" on top of the cookie and making all kinds of beautiful designs . start with another batch of royal icing . for this tutorial, i used white, which made a lovely contrast to the blue flood icing . for the detail icing, you want your consistency to be thicker and more like glue than shampoo . if you use a 10 second rule for flood icing, i would say the detail icing will be more like a 25 second rule . it should be gloppy, not runny but not overly thick . again, knowing the proper texture takes practice, so add water slowly and test the texture as you go . fill a bottle with detail icing, using the same funnel method i outlined above . attach a 1 tip for thin detailed lines, or another tip of your choice to create pretty details the star tip is nice for creating flower like designs, while the 4 tip makes leaf like designs . feel free to get creative with your tips use the detail frosting bottle to decorate, as you would with a paint brush and thick paint . press the 1 tip gently to the surface, squeeze, and lift straight up to create dots . to create straight lines, press your tip to the surface and squeeze to create a starting point . immediately lift the tip, keeping your eye on the end point where you want your line to end . keep your handy steady and pressure even as you pull towards the end point, lifting and then lowering when your line is finished . the lifting action will help you to control the straightness of the line . again, it will take some practice to get a feel for the icing... have patience and don't be too hard on yourself once your lines have been added, grasp the cookie with two fingers and gently tap to smooth out the icing lines . if you see any small bubbles, pop them with a toothpick as you go . small imperfections can usually be fixed with a toothpick, too, as long as you fix them within a minute or two of applying the icing . once it starts to dry, it becomes more difficult to ""clean up."" while the detail frosting is wet, you can also add small detail effects, like candied beads and sprinkles . the frosting will act as a glue to hold the details in place . when you're done decorating, wait at least 3 hours up to overnight to dry . the longer the frosting dries, the more stable it becomes."
